# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to mark chemical compounds as favorites (starred) and view them in a dedicated tab. Users can star/unstar compounds from the compound gallery and access their starred compounds through a separate view. The feature includes local storage persistence and is designed to be enhanced with user authentication in the future.

## Glossary
